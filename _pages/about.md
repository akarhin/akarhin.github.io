I am a doctoral candidate at Aalto University, specializing in Deep Learning (DL) solutions for condition monitoring (CM) of rotating machinery within the ARotor laboratory of the Mechatronics research group. My research focuses on overcoming critical challenges in this domain, including data scarcity, model generalization, and ensuring explainability and trustworthiness of intelligent fault diagnosis models.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my Bachelor of Science (Technology) in Mechanical and Structural Engineering and my Master of Science (Technology) at Aalto University, specializing in Mechatronics & Intelligent Systems in Mechanical Engineering. I graduated with Honors with a 4.5/5.0 GPA and my Master's thesis was titled: "Synthesizing Rotating Machine Faults into Vibration Data with Generative Adversarial Networks", which received the highest grade of 5/5.

During my studies I completed extracurricular work as a Course Assistant on courses covering Thermodynamics and Heat Transfer and Python programming. I have been recognized for my academic success with awards, including the Yrj√∂ and Senja Koivunen Foundation Grant and inclusion in the Dean's List for outstanding academic performance. Additionally, I received full funding (3 years) for my PhD in the AI-DOC funding call (more info [here](https://fcai.fi/doctoral-program)), which funded a hundred new PhDs in the field of artificial intelligence. This call was part of a larger program funded by the finnish goverment, which provided funding for a thousand new PhDs across all disciplines.
