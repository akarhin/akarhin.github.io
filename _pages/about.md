I am a doctoral researcher at Aalto University, specializing in Deep Learning (DL) solutions for monitoring and intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD) of rotating machinery. I am part of the ARotor laboratory, part of the Mechatronics research group. My research focuses on critical problems in automated monitoring of rotating machines, which include data scarcity, generalization and explainability of data-driven solutions. Currently I am in the second year of my PhD journey.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my Bachelor of Science (Technology) in Mechanical and Structural Engineering and my Master of Science (Technology) at Aalto University, specializing in Mechatronics & Intelligent Systems in Mechanical Engineering. I graduated with Honors and my Master's thesis titled: "Synthesizing Rotating Machine Faults into Vibration Data with Generative Adversarial Networks" achieved the highest grade of 5/5.

During my studies I completed extracurricular work as a Course Assistant on courses covering Thermodynamics and Heat Transfer and Python programming. I have been recognized for my academic success with awards, including the Yrj√∂ and Senja Koivunen Foundation Grant and inclusion in the Dean's List for outstanding academic performance. Additionally, I received full funding (3 years) for my PhD in the AI-DOC funding call (more info [here](https://fcai.fi/doctoral-program)), which funded a hundred new PhDs in the field of artificial intelligence. This call was part of a larger program funded by the finnish goverment, which provided funding for a thousand new PhDs across all disciplines. I also published several conference publications during my studies, one of which was later published as a journal publication.

Along my doctoral degree, I am pursuing a Master of Science degree in applied mathematics at The University of Turku.
