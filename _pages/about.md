I am a doctoral candidate at Aalto University, specializing in Deep Learning (DL) solutions for condition monitoring (CM) of rotating machinery within the ARotor laboratory of the Mechatronics research group. My research focuses on overcoming critical challenges in this domain, including data scarcity, model generalization, and ensuring explainability and trustworthiness for machine workers.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering, with a dual specialization in Mechatronics and Computer Science, at Aalto University. Graduating with Honors and a GPA of 4.5/5.0, my Master's thesis was titled: "Synthesizing Rotating Machine Faults into Vibration Data with Generative Adversarial Networks". During my academic journey, I also served as a Course Assistant, teaching courses on Thermodynamics, Heat Transfer, and Python programming. I have been recognized for my academic excellence with awards, including the Yrj√∂ and Senja Koivunen Foundation Grant and inclusion in the Dean's List for outstanding academic performance.

Passionate about advancing technology and engineering solutions, I am committed to leveraging my skills and knowledge to develop robust DL solutions that enhance condition monitoring practices for rotating machinery, ensuring reliability, efficiency, and safety in industrial applications.
