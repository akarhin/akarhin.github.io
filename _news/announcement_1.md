## Integration of AI and Sustainable Energy Management in the Pulp and Paper Industry: A Path to Decarbonization

The **pulp and paper industry (P&PI)** is known for its high energy demands, especially in mechanical refining, dewatering and drying, and friction-related losses during papermaking. Our new publication explores how **artificial intelligence (AI)** can be strategically applied to improve energy efficiency and accelerate decarbonization in this vital sector.

### 🔍 Key Findings:
- **AI-optimized mechanical refining** can reduce energy consumption by up to **15%**
- **AI-enhanced dewatering and drying** improves heat recovery, saving **10–20%** in energy
- **AI-driven friction management and aerostatic bearings** can cut energy losses by **24%**
- **AI-enabled condition monitoring** helps minimize downtime and boost overall operational efficiency
